# Swift-PDFSuite
Swift scripts for PDF manipulation, for Shortcuts or Terminal

Since Apple got rid of a python installation that you can rely on in MacOS, our choices for 'out-of-the-box' scripting are limited. AppleScript? No thanks. Perl and Ruby are still there, but who knows for how long? 

However, it is possible to use Swift as a scripting language! It's slow as a brick, compared to python, but it works. 

And, Apple has provided a mechanism for running Swift scripts in Shortcuts. So I'm translating my python scripts for PDF manipulation into Swift.

You'll find them in the scripts folder.
